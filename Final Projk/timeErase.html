        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>This section will detail the various skills of King Crimson: Requiem</p>
        <p>Each skill can have different properties, damage outputs, and effects.</p>
        <p><strong>M1's (left clicks):</strong> Pretty basic move, throws one punch per click doing 9.7 damage at max Destructive Power.</p>
        <p><strong>E - Stand Barrage:</strong> A flurry of punches, doing 1.6 damage per hit w/ max Destructive</p>
        <p><strong>R - Stand Barrage Finisher:</strong> Heavy punch that ragdolls, dealing 19.3 damage</p>
        <p><strong>Y - Chop:</strong> KCR performs a bisecting Chop that deals 12.9 damage and 0.3 bleed (damage) over time</p>
        <p><strong>T - Epitaph (1.6 a hit):</strong> Teleports behind opponent if they attack you while Epitaph is activated. If fully upgraded, KCR performs "Raging Demon" (a reference to a Street Fighter move), hitting 20 heavy punches for 1.6 damage each, totaling 32 damage.</p>
        <p><strong>H - Dimensional Slash:</strong> KCR summons a scythe in the direction the screen is facing, crippling anyone hit for 32.2 damage</p>
        <p><strong>X - Time Skip:</strong> Teleports instantly, that's it.</p>
        <p><strong>Z - Time Erase:</strong> KCR erases time, creating a separate space. The red highlight indicates where someone was before time was erased. After time is up or manually deactivated, people teleport back to where they were.</p>

        <h2>Recommended spec: Vampirism</h2>
        <p>Vampirism allows you to have faster regen, and hyper regen when your blood bar isn't empty, along with a counter.</p>

        <h3>Playstyle: </h3>
        <p>KCR is a very aggressive stand, focusing heavily on M1s (punching) with a mix of powerful abilities.</p>
