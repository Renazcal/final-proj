        <h1>"Reality... bends to my will!" - Heaven Ascended DIO</h1>
        <h1>The World: Over Heaven</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The World: Over Heaven, AKA TW:OH/TWOH, is known for its outrageous amount of damage it can do to you in the span of 5 seconds if caught off guard...</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>This section will detail the various skills of The World: Over Heaven.</p>
        <p>Each skill can have different properties, damage outputs, and effects.</p>

        <div class="skill">
            <p><strong>M1's (left clicks):</strong> Basic move, throws one punch per click doing 10.1 damage at max Destructive Power.</p>
            <p><strong>E - Stand Barrage:</strong> A flurry of punches, doing 1.6 damage per hit.</p>
            <p><strong>R - Stand Barrage Finisher:</strong> Heavy punch that ragdolls, dealing 19.3 damage.</p>
            <p><strong>T - Knife Throw:</strong> With max upgrades, throws 3 knives that deal 8.1 damage each with an AOE stun. AOE stun acts as a 4th knife, dealing another 8.1 damage.</p>
            <p><strong>Y - Reality Overwriting Punch:</strong> Deals 20.1 damage and overwrites the person it's used on, crippling and stunning them. Blockable.</p>
            <p><strong>U and X - Injury Overwrites:</strong> With max Midas Touch, U heals you for 52, and X heals another for 52.</p>
            <p><strong>H - Time Stop:</strong> Stops time for 5–9 seconds based on the upgrade. Time stop damage is nerfed to 1/3 of an opponent's health.</p>
            <p><strong>Z - Time Skip:</strong> Teleport move, that's it.</p>
            <p><strong>G - Heaven Ascended Smite:</strong> Twoh uses lightning from the heavens to strike people, dealing 30 damage. Block breaks, cannot be parried but can be cancelled.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Recommended spec: Joseph Joestar's Hamon</h2>
        <p>Hamon increases your base damage. Combined with TWOH's true damage passive, you'll deal around 15.1 per M1, shredding through other specs like Boxing, Spin, Pluck, etc.</p>

        <h3>Playstyle:</h3>
        <p>TWOH + Joseph is a random move throw playstyle, but you can chain into certain things. Aggressive playstyle.</p>

        <h4>Combos:</h4>
        <p onclick="toggleKey()" style="cursor: pointer; color: #00ff00; text-decoration: underline;">
            Combo 1: (Hamon Charged) Clacker boomerangs → dash → 3x M1s → clacker volley → 2 M1s + knives → overwrite → smite
        <br>
            Combo 2: (Hamon Charged) Clacker boomerangs → dash → 3x M1s → clacker volley → 2 M1s + knives → rebuff overdrive → overwrite + smite → time stop (M1 as many times as possible)
