        <p style="text-align: center;">
            Shadow The World (STW) is a still-developing version of The World, only appearing with its upper torso. It is based on the old arcade game *Heritage For the Future*. STW has two passives: 
            <strong>Dark Rebirth</strong>, allowing vampire users to get blood for their blood bar from M1s (though it’s countered by anyone who can hold the block button), and 
            <strong>Unrivaled Power</strong>, which makes it so you can't be stand crashed (stand crash refers to being hit by an attack that desummons your stand, such as a counter or beatdown).
        </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>This section will detail the various skills of Shadow The World.</p>
        <p>Each skill can have different properties, damage outputs, and effects.</p>

        <div class="skill">
            <p><strong>M1's (left clicks):</strong> Pretty basic move, throws one punch per click doing 9 damage at max Destructive Power.</p>
            <p><strong>E - Stand Combo:</strong> STW appears and combos the opponent with 4 punches (6.4 dmg each). During this, you can move around and attack while they are still being attacked by STW (they are stunned if this lands). The initial punch is blockable.</p>
            <p><strong>R - Heavy Chop:</strong> Lunge forward with a chop doing 17.5 damage and stun.</p>
            <p><strong>T - Knife Barrage:</strong> With max upgrades, throws 5 knives that deal 4.8 damage each, each giving 0.1 bleed.</p>
            <p><strong>Y - Charism:</strong> A counter that can be cancelled. The user stops time and surrounds the opponent with knives dealing 32.2 damage with 0.3 bleed on each knife (likely 5 knives, so 0.3x5 damage).</p>
            <p><strong>X - Time Switch:</strong> Literally useless, but some use it to annoy people in fights. It swaps your position with theirs.</p>
            <p><strong>H - Time Stop:</strong> Quickly stop time for 4 seconds. Knives are spammable, but any other time-stop stand with time resistance can walk through it.</p>
            <p><strong>Z - Time Skip:</strong> Just a teleport move, that's it.</p>
            <p><strong>G - Punishment:</strong> STW does a gut punch (or donut punch) dealing 0.3 bleed and 30 damage. With Impale III, you do 25% more damage to people under 50% health.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Recommended spec: Spin</h2>
        <p>Spin is a high stun-based spec and is very useful for combo extenders.</p>

        <h3>Playstyle</h3>
        <p>ALL STW moves ARE BLOCKABLE. You want to play carefully, as if your stand combo is blocked, it's a free barrage for the opponent. Stand combo gets you out of almost anything since it does knockback. Play a passive-aggressive style.</p>

                <p>at the time of recording, like 0/15 people i know could get on to be a test dummy so instead of a combo example ill just show keys</p>
