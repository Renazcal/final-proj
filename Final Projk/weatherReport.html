        <div id="spec-playstyle">
            <h2>Recommended spec: Vampirism</h2>
            <p>Vampirism allows you to have faster regen, and hyper regen when your blood bar isn't empty, along with a counter.</p>

            <h3>Playstyle: </h3>
            <p>WR is a very neutral stand, being highly defense-based and requires block breaks to perform combos.</p>
